%% Nezapomeňte upravit abstrakt.xmpdata.

One way to publish data in a machine-readable form on the Internet is in the form of a graph. Such data are easy to interconnect between different data sources and thus create a large network of linked data. In order to visualize this data, we need to use graph tools, which can often be impractical because they usually show us all the information about the graph.

The aim of this work is to create a web application that is able to visualize those graph data, provide information about them, and browse them using so-called configurations. A configuration describes what data from a large set of data on the Internet we want to display, how we visualize them, and how we can look at them. It allows us to filter out hundreds of uninteresting information, thus shielding users from a complex network of linked data so that users can focus on the data that interests them.
